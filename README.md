# CryptoClustering

In this assignment given by Birmingham University Data Boot Camp, Python and unsupervised machine learning methods have been used to predict if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes.

1-Crypto market data has been normalized using StandardScaler() module from scikit-learn library.

2- Using elbow method best value for k has been found using the Original Scaled DataFrame. 

3-Cryptocurrencies have been clustered with K-means using the Original Scaled Data.

4-Clusters are optimized with Principal Component Analysis.

5-Best Value for k has been found using the PCA Data.

6-Cryptocurrencies have been clustered with K-means using the PCA Data.
